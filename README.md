# Contact Form 7: Support Deprecated Settings
Provide continued support for `on_sent_ok` and `on_submit` within Contact Form 7's Additional Settings

Per the developer, Contact Form 7 will no longer support the `on_sent_ok` and `on_submit` settings available on the `Additional Settings` screen. Both settings are currently deprecated, with plans to be completely unsupported before the end of 2017. https://contactform7.com/additional-settings/

This plugin is meant to be a band-aid to quickly get your `Additional Settings` working. It reads the `Additional Settings` data and adds a javascript block when the form is output on the page, using DOM Events as suggested by the CF7 author. https://contactform7.com/dom-events/
